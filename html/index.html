            "PC Master Race" is a term that refers to a subculture of gamers and computer <br>
            enthusiasts who advocate the use of personal computers (PCs) as the superior <br>
            gaming platform. Members of the PC Master Race argue that PCs offer a better <br>
            gaming experience due to their customizability, greater processing power and <br>
            graphics, and the availability of a wide range of exclusive and third-party <br>
            game titles. <br> <br>

            The term "PC Master Race" originated as a joke on the Reddit forums in 2011, <br>
            but has since become a popular and, in some cases, controversial term in the <br>
            gaming and tech community. Some have criticized the elitist and condescending <br>
            attitude some members of the PC Master Race take towards console gamers or those <br>
            who can't afford to build or upgrade a high-end PC. <br> <br>

            The origin of the term "PC Master Race" can be traced back to a Reddit gaming <br>
            forum thread in 2011. The user named "pedro19" wrote in response to a comment <br>
            about the superiority of game consoles: "The Game console is a decent platform, <br>
            but PC games will always be better? Why? Because PC games have better graphics, <br>
            more control, and are less expensive." <br> <br>

            In response to this comment, another user named "Artemisx" responded with a joke, <br>
            writing "PC Master Race!" as a claim that PC gamers were superior to console <br>
            gamers. The term quickly caught on in the Reddit community, and other users began <br>
            using it as a way of asserting the superiority of the PC gaming platform. <br> <br>

            PC Gamer

        <p>
            The beginnings of the PC Gamer go back to the 1980s, when the first personal <br>
            computers such as the IBM PC and Apple II began to gain popularity in the consumer <br>
            market. In the beginning, PC games were simple and mostly limited to text games <br>
            or text based adventure games. However, as personal computer technology improved, <br>
            so did PC gaming. <br> <br>

            In the 1990s, the rise of real-time strategy games and role-playing games for PCs, <br>
            such as Command & Conquer, Warcraft, and Diablo, helped fuel interest in PC gaming. <br>
            Furthermore, the popularity of network and online gaming also contributed to the <br>
            growth of the PC Gaming community. <br> <br>

            In the 2000s, the advent of first-person shooters like Half-Life and Counter-Strike, <br>
            as well as the increasing use of 3D graphics, brought the PC gaming experience <br>
            to the next level. The availability of low-cost, indie games through services like <br>
            Steam has also helped increase the popularity of PC gaming in recent years. <br> <br>

            Today, the PC Gamer has become a subculture of gamers and computer enthusiasts <br>
            who uphold the superiority of PCs as the ultimate gaming platform. The PC Gaming <br>
            community remains active and vibrant, with a wide range of cutting-edge games, <br>
            hardware, and technology available to those seeking the best gaming experience. <br> <br>
